<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The steps to create and implement a basic GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture:

- 1)Importing Libraries:
Start by importing the necessary libraries to build the GAN. You can use deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- 2)Loading the Dataset:
Choose and load a dataset for training the GAN. Common datasets include MNIST, CIFAR-10, etc.

- 3)Creating the Discriminator Network:
First, create the discriminator network. This network is typically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that discriminates between real and fake images.

- 4)Creating the Generator Network:
Next, create the generator network. This network takes random noise as input and generates images that resemble real images. The generator can be a CNN or a Deconvolutional Neural Network (DNN).

- 5)Setting Up the Training Loop:
Set up a loop to train the GAN. This loop involves training the generator and discriminator networks alternately in each iteration. The goal of the GAN is to strike a balance between the generator and discriminator.

- 6)Training:
Train the generator and discriminator networks. During the training process, the generator generates images resembling real images from random noise inputs, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

- 7)Evaluation of Results:
After training, you can generate new images using the generator network. You can also evaluate how well the discriminator performs in distinguishing between real and generated images.

- 8)Visualization of Results:
Visualize the training results by examining how closely the generated images resemble real images. This can be done by comparing generated images with real images visually.

<b>In this implementation, we used TENSORFLOW deep learning library and MNIST dataset. Some generated images are in gan_images directory</b>
